Chapter 02 Worksheet
 
     
     
 1. Give an example of a binary number. (While a number such as ``1'' can be a
    binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number, try coming up with an example that
    better illustrates the differences between the different bases of numbers.)
- 1001 0100 0110 1111 1001 
 
 2. Give an example of a decimal number.
- 12
 
 3. Give an example of a hexadecimal number.
- A0 02 FF 82
 
 4. Convert the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 from binary to decimal.
- 1 -> 1
- 10 -> 1010
- 100 -> 1100 100
- 1000 ->1111 1010 00
 
 5. What is a compiler?
 - A compiler takes the program typed in by the user and turns it into machine code
 
 6. What is source code?
 - the program typed in by the user
 
 7. What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
 - a computer programming language consisting of binary or hexadecimal instructions which a computer can respond to directly.
 
 8. What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
 - Lisp
 - A first generation language is a grouping of programming languages that are machine level languages used to program first-generation computers.
  Originally, no translator was used to compile or assemble the first-generation language. 
  
 9. What is a second generation language?
   - Second generation languages, or 2GL, are low-level assembly languages that are specific to a particular computer and processor.
   
10. What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)
 -  a high-level computer programming language that tends to be more machine-independent and programmer-friendly than the machine code 
    of the first-generation and assembly languages of the second-generation
    
11. What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?
 - Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and
   translates the whole of it into machine code at once.- An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. 
   However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.
   
12. Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
    List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.
    - JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, PHP and C#
    (https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-programming-languages-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-choices-for-developers/)
 
13. Look at the job boards and see what languages people are looking for.
    List the languages and the job board you looked at.
 - c++ (e.Solutions)
 - c++ und PHP (https://psi-technics.com/)
 - SQL (DRK)
 
14. What is the difference between the ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' of a
    language?
 - Put simply, syntax refers to grammar, while semantics refers to meaning. 
 
15. Pick a piece of technology, other than a computer you use regularly. Briefly
    describe the hardware and software that run on it.
 - iPhone/iPad -> iOS
