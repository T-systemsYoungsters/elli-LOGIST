Chapter 09 Worksheet
 
     
    For the code below, write a prediction on what it will output. Then run
    the code and state if your prediction was accurate or not. If your prediction
    is incorrect, make sure you understand why.
 
    If you don't know why the code runs the way it does, watch the video at the
    end of the assignment for an explanation. If you are looking at the text-only
    version of this worksheet, go on-line and find the HTML version of this worksheet

    This next section involves finding the mistakes in the code. If you can't
    find the mistake, check out the video at the end for the answer and an explanation
    on what is wrong.
 
    This section is worth 7 points.
     
20. Correct the following code: (Don't let it print out the word ``None'')
     
    def sum(a, b, c):
        print(a + b + c)
 
    print(sum(10, 11, 12))

def sum(a, b, c):
        print(a + b + c)
 
sum(10, 11, 12)

21. Correct the following code: (x should increase by one, but it doesn't.)
     
    def increase(x):
        return x + 1
 
    x = 10
    print("X is", x, " I will now increase x." )
    increase(x)
    print("X is now", x)

            return sum
 
    list = [45, 2, 10, -5, 100]
    print(sum_list(list))
A:

    return sum
 
list = [45, 2, 10, -5, 100]
print(sum_list(list))

25. Correct the following code: (This almost reverses the string. What is wrong?)
     
    def reverse(text):
        result = ""
        text_length = len(text)
        for i in range(text_length):

26. Correct the following code:
     
    def get_user_choice():
        while True:
            command = input("Command: ")
            if command = f or command = m or command = s or command = d or command = q:

    (13 pts) For this section, write code that satisfies the following items:
     
27. Write a function that prints out ``Hello World.''
 def print_hello():
    print("Hello World")
 
28. Write code that will call the function in the prior problem.
 def print_hello():
    print("Hello World")
 
print_hello()

29. Write a function that prints out ``Hello Bob'', and will take a parameter to
    let the caller specify the name. Do not put an input statement inside
    the function! Use a parameter.
def print_name(x):
    print("Hello ", x)

30. Write code that will call the function in the prior problem.
print_name("Bob")

31. Write a function that will take two numbers as parameters (not as input from
    the user) and print their product (i.e. multiply them).
def sum(x,y):
        print(x*y)
   

32. Write code that will call the prior function.
sum(4,4) 

33. Write a function that takes in two parameters. The first parameter will be a
    string named phrase. The second parameter will be a number named
    count. Print phrase to the screen count times.
    (e.g., the function takes in "Hello" and 5, then prints "Hello" five times.)
def smth(phrase, count):
   for i in range(count):
       print(phrase) 

34. Write code to call the previous function.
smth("Hi", 5)

35. Write code for a function that takes in a number, and returns the square of
    that number. (I'm not asking for the square root, but the number squared.)
    Note, this function should RETURN the answer, not print it out.
def sqr(x):
    return x*x

36. Write code to call the function above and print the output.
print(sqr(5))

37. Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the
    centrifugal force. The formula for centrifugal force is: 
    F=m(v^2/r)
    F is force, m is mass, r is radius, and v is angular velocity.
def cen_force(m,v,r):
    return (m*(v*v/r))

38. Write code to call the function above and display the result.
print(cen_force(6,2,3))

39. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as a parameter, and prints out
    each number individually using a for loop.
def print_list(x):
    for item in range(len(x)):
        print(x[item])
