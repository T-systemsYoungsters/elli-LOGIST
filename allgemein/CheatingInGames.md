# How does cheating works in modern games (*still in progress*)

## What tricks are commonly used to cheat in video games?

Video game cheaters use a wide range of tricks to gain an unfair advantage. Here are the most popular forms of cheating:

- ***Aim Bots*** ensure cheaters automatically have perfect aim at any opponent.
- ***Trigger Bots*** cause the cheater’s weapons to automatically fire when their target is in the crosshairs.
- ***Wall Hacks*** enable cheaters to see hidden threats or targets through walls
- ***Camera Hacks*** give cheaters a wider view of the game world than other players or than the developer intended.
- ***Lag Switches*** delay an opponent’s action, so the cheater has an advantage.
- ***ESP on-screen visuals*** that reveal information to the cheater, such as the cooldown time of enemy abilities or the locations of spawned loot.
- ***Removal*** eliminates challenging elements of the game to make the cheater’s play easier.
- ***Radar*** gives cheaters a map showing the location of opponents, items, power-ups etc.
- ***Unlocking*** gives immediate access to characters, achievements or costumes that must usually be bought or earned.
- ***Drop Hacks and DDOS*** (distributed denial of service) disconnect the cheater just before they lose a game or disconnect opponents to make game play easier.
- ***Boosting/Farming/Stat-Padding*** artificially boost win rates and rankings by using fake accounts or opponents who agree to lose.
- ***Currency Manipulation*** gives cheaters easy access to currency via coin farms while everyone else must earn or buy it.
- ***Scripting*** allows cheaters to automatically respond perfectly and instantly to opponent actions.
